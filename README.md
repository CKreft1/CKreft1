Hello, I am an amateur programmer interested in data representation, communication, image processing and analysis, video games, and circuitry.
In the past, I have worked on mathematical models for chemistry education and image detection to improve manufacturing processes for biomedical devices.
I am currently proficient in python and MATLAB, and I am studying java and C++.
I would like to thank Michael Reeves for inspiring this journey into computer science.
